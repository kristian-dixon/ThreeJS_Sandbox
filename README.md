Note: This project is intended to be the equivalent of an artist doodling on paper. As such the code quality may not always meet the standards I set for myself as I'm using it to jam out ideas when I'm feeling creative. 

My dream for this project is to have a new home that is accessible for my graphics work, I've spent years building random technical pieces in Unity that nobody gets to see I've decided to change that by rebuilding everything in Three.js or WebGPU where necessary. Progress is trundling along but it'll get there eventually.
